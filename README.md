Ionic 4 release with more powerful and nice features like Vue, React etc... But if you play with Ionic for enough time and still working with Ionic 4 and Angular it will be nice that you can easy integrate Ionic 4 with Angular Cli and Nx workspace.

Imagine now you can really make a full-stack from front-end (web, mobile) and backend in 1 Nx monorepos with NestJS, Ionic 4, Angular 7,... And it's all in Typescript, one language rule them all. 

A month ago when I working with my 9ecom product I still need to config angular.json by hand but now you can just add ionic 4 to your project with ng add, even you are in a Nx workspace.
